## Tic Tac Toe Game

#### Overview

Create an interactive game based on user inputs and a board created with strings within this Jupyter notebook.
The main purpose of this project is to introduce how logic can be chained together to produce a simple game.

When I first started programming, I purchased the "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python". Like most developers, I part completed many of courses and struggled specifically with the milestone project. Since I've came a long way since then, I decided to return to some of these courses and see how difficult some of the assignments felt now. Also its nice to build the habit of completing what you started. 

Fortunately it was very easy, helped brush up on my fundamentals and practice my coding skills.

#### Getting Started

Simply open the tictactoe Jupyter Notebook and execute all of the cells.

You'll be prompted by the command terminal (or your code editor) to enter your actions for the game.

For example, "Which position would like to place your marker". 

The num pad on your key board represents the positions of the board:
7 8 9 <br>
4 5 6 <br>
1 2 3 <br>

This type of game inside Jupyter notebook is not to exciting, and will share more exiting content as I progress through my game dev journey.
