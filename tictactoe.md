## Tic Tac Toe Game

#### Overview

Create an interactive game based on user inputs and a board created with strings within this Jupyter notebook.
The main purpose of this project is to introduce how logic can be chained together to produce a simple game.

When I first started programming, I purchased the "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python". Like most developers, I part completed many of courses and struggled specifically with the milestone project.After a few years I decided to return to some of these courses and see how difficult I found the assignments. 

Fortunately it was very easy but still helped brush up on my fundamentals and practice my coding skills.

#### Getting Started

Simply open the tictactoe Jupyter Notebook and execute all of the cells.

You'll be prompted by the command terminal (or your code editor) to enter your actions for the game.

For example, "Which position would like to place your marker". 

The num pad on your key board represents the positions of the board:
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3
